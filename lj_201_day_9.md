#201 Learning Journal - Day 9

Today was a nice break from javascript! Getting back into css took a 
little adjustment, but once I got going I thought it went really well. 
I'm not totally happy with my styling so far, but overall I am 
relatively satisfied with how it looks. Design definitely isn't my 
strong suit. Going through the form code line by line really helped 
deepen my understanding of the core concepts. I think things are finally 
starting to really click...we'll see if that's the case as we dive 
deeper into js.
