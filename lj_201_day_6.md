#201 Learning Journal - Day 6

Today was definitely the toughest day so far. I'm trying to process the 
large amount of information we have received so far and put it into 
practice. I get the process of making functions, but I'm having trouble 
with the problem solving aspect of functions. I need to take some time 
and really study my code once I get it working so I can fully understand 
what is happening at each step. I think it's just going to take time 
before it finally clicks. Although I'm having a tough time with the 
current lab, I'm still excited to get back to it...more so actually!
