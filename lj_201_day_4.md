#201 Learning Journal - Day 4

Today we learned about some more css styling and layout. We learned about 
positioning, including absolute, relative, and fixed positioning. I already 
knew about these attributes, but I learned more about how they actually 
function, which will help a lot when getting pages laid out. I also learned 
more about the float and clear attributes. 

In pair programming, we got a crash course in dealing with merge conflicts. I 
learned how difficult it can be to dive into the middle of someone elses code 
and try to work your way around it without breaking something along the way.
