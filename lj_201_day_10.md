#201 Learning Journal - Day 10

Today was a great day for CSS. The code demo in which Aaron went over 
CSS positioning was incredibly helpful. I had the absolute and relative 
values reversed when trying to use them in the past. The pair 
programming exercise was really encouraging. I feel like Caitlin and I 
did a really good job with the assignment. Today was a big confidence 
boost and a great way to end the week.
