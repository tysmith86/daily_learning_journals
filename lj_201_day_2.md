#201 Learning Journal - Day 2

Today we reviewed a little more HTML, as well as CSS. We worked on 
conditionals in JavaScript, and coded an about me guessing game. I 
learned some shortcuts in HTML, such as typing "html" to auto fill the 
boilerplate code, using <ctrl /> on highlighted code to make it a 
comment, as well as using ctrl up/down to move lines up or down. We 
learned about the push, pop, shift/unshift, and splice methods for 
arrays.
