#201 Learning Journal - Day 3

Today we went over different loops, such as for and while. We went over the logical operators || and &&. I learned how to style and format lists using list-style. The lab proved to be a bit more difficult than I was expecting. I have a decent amount of experience with for and while loops, but the requirements of the lab were beyond my prior experience...which is a good thing! I believe I met the minimum requirements, but there is still a lot more I wanted to accomplish. I will work on that in my own time.
