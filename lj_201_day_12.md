#201 Learning Journal - Day 12

Today I learned how to use chart.js. More importantly, I learned how to 
use the docs for chart.js. I can see how powerful and useful libraries 
are. I'm looking forward to using more libraries in the future. The lab 
went well today. I got caught up from yesterday, and was able to get a 
start on the chart. I don't have the chart showing the correct 
information yet, but I believe I know what I need to do. This week has 
been pretty tough so far, but not quite as tough as last week. Hopefully 
the material this week will really click like last week's material did.
