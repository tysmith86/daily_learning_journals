#201 Learning Journal - Day  7

I learned a lot today, including creating objects using object 
constructor (a big step up from codecademy), as well as how to use js to 
create a table in html. Working with object constructors wasn't too 
terribly difficult for me, but I had a hard time with the table. I used 
the codepen example to get everything laid out, although I will need to 
redo the code that renders the table since each object is creating it's 
own, new table, instead of one table with 5 rows. I will be sure to ask 
for help with this if I get stuck on it for too long. I hope some things 
over the past couple of days start clicking soon! I just need to 
stick with it and not get discouraged.
