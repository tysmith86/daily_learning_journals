#201 Learning Journal - Day 11

Today I learned about storing data in the browser's local storage. The 
code demo was helpful as it gave us a good start for the lab. The lab 
assignment was to start work on the bus mall clicktracker. Using Aaron's 
code from the demo, I wrote out a plan for what I needed to get a good 
start on the project. Once I wrote down what I needed to do, I was able 
to get it coded without referring back to Aaron's code too often. Once I 
got the 3 pictures up and the click event working, I became stuck. I 
changed between trying to get the click tracker working and making the 
photos not repeat themselves. I thought I had a few promising ideas for 
this, but I realized I wasn't even close. Aaron said that we can get 
attributes the same way that we set them, so that gives me something to 
go on when I tackle this problem again. I need to make sure that I ask 
questions more often when I get stuck on a problem. I don't feel like 
today was a productive day for me, but tomorrow I will turn that around.
