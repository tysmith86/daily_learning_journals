#201 Learning Journal - Day 13

Today I learned how to store and retrieve items from local storage. I 
learned that everything in local storage is stored as a string, and you 
have to coerce it into the data type you want. In the case of arrays, 
you have to parse the string. The lab went really well. It was the first 
time in js during the last 2 weeks that I actually finished the lab 
requirements relatively quickly, and was able to move on to css and other 
code.
