#201 Learning Journal - Day 14

Today I learned about css wireframes. It was incredibly helpful 
recreating the wireframe example in class. The float and clear 
attributes became much more clear. The css calc function was pretty mind 
blowing! I had no idea you could do anything like that! I think I'm 
going to play around with some wireframing as some practice. We started 
talking about our projects for project week. I think we have a good idea 
going, and I'm excited to start coding it.
