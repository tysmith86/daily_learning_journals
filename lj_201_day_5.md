#201 Learning Journal - Day 5

The CSS content in class today was most review for me, but I did get 
some clarification on styling children elements - both the first child 
and all children. I also got a better understanding on how to style 
elements more precisely. I always struggle with styling more elements 
than I intend to, or having a hard time picking out the right element to 
style. This leads to a lot of unnessecary id's and classes.

The lab today was great! I struggled a little bit with passing 3 
parameters into a function that is only set to take 2. Once I got that 
figured out, the rest of it went really well. It was a fun lab overall.
