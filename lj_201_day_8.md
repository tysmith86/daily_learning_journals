#201 Learning Journal - Day 8

I felt a lot better about my understanding of the core concepts today. 
The code demo/review helped a lot! Learning about using forms to update 
the dom was a lot of fun. I found it to be much easier than adding a 
table to the dom...fewer parts to keep track of. The lab went pretty 
well today. I made a functioning form in the first hour. I then spent 
the majority of lab fixing my table, which in turn ended up breaking my 
form. I wasn't able to get that working in lab, but I did get it figured 
out at home. I'm starting to feel a little more confident about what I'm 
learning.
